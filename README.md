# 🔁 Exploring Loops in Python
This project showcases beginner-friendly Python programs that demonstrate the power of `for` and `while` loops through practical, fun mini-projects.

### 1️⃣ Countdown Timer
Counts down from a number entered by the user using a `while` loop.
**Example:**
Enter a starting number: 5
5 4 3 2 1 Blast off! 🚀

### 2️⃣ Multiplication Table
Prints the multiplication table (1–12) for a number using a `for` loop.
**Example:**
Enter a number: 4
4 x 1 = 4
4 x 12 = 48

### 3️⃣ Factorial Calculator
Calculates the factorial of a number using a `for` loop.
**Example:**
Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120.



### 4️⃣ Number Guessing Game 🎲
Generates a random number between 1–100. The user has 10 tries to guess it.

**Features:**
- Hints if guess is too high or too low
- Tracks number of attempts
- Ends with win or game-over message

**Example:**
Guess the number: 50
Too high! Try again.
Guess the number: 37
🎉 You guessed it in 2 attempts!
